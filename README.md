# takuzu in C

Takuzu is a puzzle game consisting of filling in a grid with the numbers 0 and 1 by logical deduction.
These are 8x8 or 4x4 grids. Each grid contains only a 0 or a 1, and must be completed according to three rules:

- as many 1s as 0s on each line and on each column;
- no more than 2 identical numbers side by side;
- 2 rows or 2 columns cannot be identical.


To execute the code, you need to compile and then run main() from the main.c file.

In order to enter a choice you will be asked to enter integers. To do so, you need to press the chosen integer and then 'enter'.

In the terminal, you can write -1 at any time you want to exit or restart the game.

Enjoy the game !
